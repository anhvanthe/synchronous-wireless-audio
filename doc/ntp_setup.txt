How to set up ntp:

######
SERVER
######

note: the following actions all require sudo
copy /src/server/ntp.conf to /etc/ntp.conf
restart the ntp server /etc/init.d/ntp restart

query the ntp daemon with "ntpq -p"
if the server is online, it should list several servers that your ubuntu system is syncing its time to
if the server is not connected to the internet, the only item in the list should be LOCAL

######
CLIENT
######

note: the following actions all require sudo
copy /src/server/ntp.conf to /etc/ntp.conf
edit the line: server <ip_address> iburst to reflect the IP of your server
restart the ntp server /etc/init.d/ntp restart

query the ntp daemon with "ntpq -p"
for the first few minutes the server will be listed as INIT
after NTP has synced up the clocks the commmand will list the jitter, offest, and other stuff
note: the only item in the result should be the hostname or IP of your ubuntu machine NOT the host if you are using a VM
