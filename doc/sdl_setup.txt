To play sound using SDL on the raspberry pi, follow these instructions:

Update the advanced package manager by running:

sudo apt-get update

Next, pull down and install the SDL2 library by running:

sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev

Now, compile the example playwav.c file and link the SDL library:

gcc playwav.c -I/usr/include/SDL2 -lSDL2

Lastly, run the program:

./a.out


**NOTE: Keep in mind, in order to confirm sound output from the pi while the program is running, you will need to connect headphones/speakers to the pi.
