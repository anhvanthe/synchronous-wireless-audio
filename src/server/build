# this is s shell script for the server code because its more convenient than a make file right now

# you should have everything you need to run this, and git SHOULD have copied this as an executable, otheriwse you will have to run:
# chmod +x build

# then you need to install SDL if you dont already have it
# see Kevin's documentation -> /doc/sdl_setup.txt
# sudo apt-get update
# sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev

# then you shud be able to run make and get this working
# please let me (Brian Crafton) know otherwise

gcc -shared -Wl,-soname,server -o server.so -fPIC server.c list.c -pthread -I/usr/include/SDL2 -lSDL2
